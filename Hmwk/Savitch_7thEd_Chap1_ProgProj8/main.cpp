 * Homework:
 * Write a program that allows the user to enter a number of quarters, dimes, 
 * and nickels and then outputs the monetary value of the coins in cents. For 
 * example, if the user enters 2 for the number of quarters, 3 for the number 
 * of dimes, and 1 for the number of nickels, then the program should output 
 * that the coins are worth 85 cents.
