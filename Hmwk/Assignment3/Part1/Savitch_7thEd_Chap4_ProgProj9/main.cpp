 * Homework: 
 * Write a program that asks for the userâ€™s 
 * - height
 * - weight
 * - age 
 * Then computes clothing sizes according to the formulas: 
 * 
 * - Hat size = weight in pounds divided by height in inches and all that multiplied by 2.9.
 * 
 * - Jacket size (chest in inches) = height times weight divided by 288 and then 
 *                                        adjusted by adding 1/8 of an inch for each 10 years over age 30. 
 * (Note that the adjustment only takes place after a full 10 years. So, there is 
 * no adjustment for ages 30 through 39, but 1/8 of an inch is added for age 40.)
 * 
 * - Waist in inches = weight divided by 5.7 and then 
 *                        adjusted by adding 1/10 of an inch for each 2 years over age 28. 
 * (Note that the adjustment only takes place after a full 2 years. So, there is no adjustment for 
 * age 29, but 1/10 of an inch is added for age 30.)
 * 
 * Use functions for each calculation. Your program should allow the user to repeat this calculation as often as 
 * the user wishes.
