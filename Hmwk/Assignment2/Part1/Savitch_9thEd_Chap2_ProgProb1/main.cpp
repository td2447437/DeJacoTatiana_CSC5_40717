 * Homework: 
 * A government research lab has concluded that an artificial 
 * sweetener commonly used in diet soda pop will cause death in laboratory 
 * mice. A friend of yours is desperate to lose weight but cannot give up soda 
 * pop. * Your friend wants to know how much diet soda pop it is possible to 
 * drink without dying as a result.
 * 
 * Write a program to supply the answer.
 * 1. The input to the program is the amount of artificial sweetener needed to 
 *    kill a mouse, the weight of the mouse, and the weight of the dieter. 
 *    * To ensure the safety of your friend, be sure the program requests the  
 *    weight at which the dieter will stop dieting, rather than the dieterâ€™s 
 *    current weight.
 * 
 * 2. Assume that diet soda contains 1/10th of 1% artificial sweetener. 
 *    Use a variable declaration with the modifier const to give a name to this 
 *    fraction. * You may want to express the percent as the double value 
 *    0.001. 
 * 
 * 3. Your program should allow the calculation to be repeated as often as the 
 *    user wishes.
