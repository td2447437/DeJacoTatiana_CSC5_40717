 * Homework: 
 * Workers at a particular company have won a 7.6% (0.076) pay increase 
 * retroactive for six months. 
 * 
 * Write a program that; 
 * 1. Takes an employeeâ€™s previous annual salary as input 
 * 
 * 2. outputs:
 *    - the amount of retroactive pay due the employee, 
 *    - the new annual salary, 
 *    - and the new monthly salary. 
 * 
 * 3. Use a variable declaration with the modifier const to express the 
 *    pay increase. 
 * 
 * 4. Your program should allow the calculation to be repeated as 
 *    often as the user wishes.
