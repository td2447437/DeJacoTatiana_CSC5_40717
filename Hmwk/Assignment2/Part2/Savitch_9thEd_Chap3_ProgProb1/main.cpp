 * Homework:
 * Write a program that computes the cost of a long-distance call. The cost of 
 * the call is determined according to the following rate schedule:
 * 
 * a. Any call started between 8:00am and 18:00pm, Monday through Friday, is 
 *    billed at a rate of $0.40 per minute.
 * b. Any call starting before 8:00 am or after 18:00 pm, Monday through Friday, 
 *    is charged at a rate of $0.25 per minute.
 * c. Any call started on a Saturday or Sunday is charged at a rate of 
 *    $0.15 per minute.
 *
 * The input will consist of 
 * - the day of the week, 
 * - the time the call started, 
 * - and the length of the call in minutes. 
 * 
 * The output will be the cost of the call. The time is to be input in 
 * 24-hour notation, so the time 1:30 pm is input as
 *       13:30
 * The day of the week will be read as one of the following pairs of character 
 * values, which are stored in two variables of type char:
 *       Mo  Tu  We  Th  Fr  Sa  Su
 * 
 * - Be sure to allow the user to use either uppercase or lowercase letters or
 *   a combination of the two. 
 * - The number of minutes will be input as a value of type int. 
 *   (You can assume that the user rounds the input to a whole number of 
 *   minutes.) 
 * 
 * Your program should include a loop that lets the user repeat this 
 * calculation until the user says she or he is done.
